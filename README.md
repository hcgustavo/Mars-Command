# Mars Command
A Sci-Fi FPS game developed for the A THINKING APE's challenge in the Vanhackaton.

The game is set on Mars where colonizers installed a high-tec military base with automated turrets and robots to defend it.
Scientists found out some unknown crystals in dominated area of the planet. They really want to take them to Earth to study
the crystals' properties, nut the colonizers won't let that happen.
That's when you enter the game as a space captain ready to bring these rare crystal to Earth. It's not going to be an easy task.
Get ready to fight high-tech robots and turrets with heavy laser-weapons.

- Mission:
Find all the five crystals in the area and come back to your spaceship safely.

- Features: Defy enemies with a powerful laser gun. Robots with some level of intelligence: they move around the base all the time, and when they see you, get ready to get shot be followed by them. Two types of turrets with different features (shooting range, fire power and strength).
